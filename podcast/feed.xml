        <itunes:subtitle>Who even talks on the phone anymore?</itunes:subtitle>
        <itunes:author>Raymund Lew &amp; Janessa Vandenberghe</itunes:author>
        <description>Nessa and I talk on the phone about once a week. For a while, I'd wanted to record them because the conversations mean a lot to us. So, one day we just did. Our conversations explore the intricacies of daily life, and we tend to get out of our comfort zones. We invite you to get to know us in an organic way, because we're also getting to know ourselves in the process. They are as much for us as they are for you.

            <itunes:subtitle>"Our phone calls aren't even going to be that long!" turned into 2.5 hours of conversation flowing from asking for help at work, becoming Bruce Lee, and trying to take the idea of marriage seriously when the concept of getting married doesn't matter to you.
