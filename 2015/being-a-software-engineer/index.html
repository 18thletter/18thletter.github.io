You can find the original <a href="http://www.sparkcentral.com/blog/being-a-software-engineer-2/">here</a>.</em></h2> <hr /> <p>There seem to be a lot of posts written about how to become a software developer, but not much about what to do when you are working as one. The following actions and concepts help me to be successful in my role.</p> <p><strong>The most important thing about being a developer is the desire to be a developer.</strong></p> <p>Choosing to do this type of work is a lifestyle choice. Sure, we’re not always head-down headphones-on deep in code, but inevitably a lot of time is going to be spent thinking about software and its design. Certainly, a lot of time is spent staring at a computer screen. Just listen to this speech by Alan Watts about following your desire.</p> <center><iframe class="container" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VPCp5xsP-vk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center> <h1 id="exercise">Exercise.</h1> <p>Bobby Fischer has said “Your body has to be in top condition. Your chess deteriorates as your body does. You can’t separate body from mind.” While programming isn’t chess, it is a taxing mental activity. Exercise energizes me, helps me maintain sanity after staring at a screen all day, gives me an excuse to shower, and enables me to sleep like a baby.</p> <h1 id="try-to-get-a-lot-of-rest">Try to get a lot of rest.</h1> <p>I could benefit from more sleep — that’s why <em>try</em> is used in this context. I’ve heard much about how getting enough sleep is the best way to stay focused, alert, and able to perform. This <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB923008887262090895" target="_blank">WSJ article</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_iliff_one_more_reason_to_get_a_good_night_s_sleep?language=en" target="_blank">TED talk</a> come to mind.</p> <p>When I’m sleep deprived, I find that focusing on anything becomes difficult. A good night’s sleep allows me to be productive in a way that coffee, energy drinks, nor even exercise can reproduce.</p> <h1 id="read">Read.</h1> <p>Learning is essential to an engineer’s vocation. It’s also what keeps me excited and coming back to work every day. I read and listen to podcasts. Some of my favorites are <a href="https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/" target="_blank">Tara Brach</a>, <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/" target="_blank">This American Life</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/?showDate=2015-08-07" target="_blank">TED Radio Hour</a>, <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss’ podcast</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=clean%20code&amp;qid=1439489512&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0" target="_blank">Domain Driven Design</a>.</p> <h1 id="write-a-lot-of-code">Write a lot of code.</h1> <p>Write a lot of it, read a lot of it, and review a lot of it. Code reviews and side projects are two of the best ways to stay immersed, agile, and flexible. Like any other skill, practice is the quickest road to improvement.</p> <p>Here at Sparkcentral, we approach our platform design using a methodology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_blank"><em>domain driven design</em></a>. A lot of my time is spent talking about domain models and software design, and bouncing around ideas.</p> <h1 id="ask-for-help-speak-up-question-things">Ask for help. Speak up. Question things.</h1> <p>I have impostor syndrome. We all do sometimes. Whenever I’m struggling, I remember that this stuff isn’t easy, and my team will happily collaborate and offer information.</p> <p>Whether your team is one or twenty, your opinion holds weight, so speak up. As soon as you realize you don’t get it, ask a question because you probably don’t have enough information. I also try to give away as much knowledge as possible to the rest of the team.</p> <p>Interacting with people can brew honest feedback, and this is helpful in fostering ideas, solving problems, being accountable, and good old fashioned camaraderie. Kent Beck, a software engineer and coach at Facebook, says it better than I ever could in his <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/self-image" target="_blank">Ease at Work talk</a>.</p> <h1 id="take-breaks">Take breaks.</h1> <p>Seriously. The code is going to be there when you get back. I used to try to push through something — to keep at it even far into the night past when I should be functioning properly anymore. Now, I listen to my body: when I recognize that I may be going at suboptimal brain power, I get up and take a walk, get a snack, or converse. Often, as I’m walking to Muni, I discover the solution to the problem I was working on an hour before.</p> <p>I move around the office frequently. At the beginning of the day, I’ll stand at my desk, but you’ll also find me hunkered down on a Fatboy, at the kitchen picnic tables, or even sprawled down on the ground with my laptop open in front of me.</p> <p>I immerse myself in hobbies outside of work. When I play basketball, read, travel, or meditate, I leave the project out of my head and devote all of my attention to that activity. I’ve found that this gives my life balance, and also helps prevent burning out.</p> <h1 id="take-your-time">Take your time.</h1> <p>Both you and I know that a lot of the job involves Google searches and StackOverflow. While the internet is a great discovery tool, in most cases it only serves to point you in the right direction. To really learn a the nuances of an API or a framework, there is no better source of truth than the docs and the code itself. So get in there, get dirty, take your time, and tinker.</p> <h1 id="smile">Smile.</h1> <p>You do go here, don’t you?</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/18thletter" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/raymundlew" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/the18thlettr" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> </div> </footer> </main> <script src="/assets/js/jquery-2.1.1.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
