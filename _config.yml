  subtitle: Who even talks on the phone anymore?
  author: Raymund Lew &amp; Janessa Vandenberghe
  description: >
    Nessa and I talk on the phone about once a week. For a while, I'd wanted to
    record them because the conversations mean a lot to us. So, one day we just
    did. Our conversations explore the intricacies of daily life, and we tend to
    get out of our comfort zones. We invite you to get to know us in an organic
    way, because we're also getting to know ourselves in the process. They are
    as much for us as they are for you.
