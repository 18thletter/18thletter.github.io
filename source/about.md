I live and work in San Francisco. I love talking to people about what they
do and how they feel. Life is interesting and simple, and I'm curious,
so I slow down and listen.

I also write software for a living. You can find the Github and LinkedIn links
at the bottom in the footer. The little icons are sprinkled throughout this
site.
